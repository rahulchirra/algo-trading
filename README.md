## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

### Q: Can I do this workout every day?
**A:** No, muscles need 48-72 hours recovery. Follow the 6-day plan with Sunday rest.

### Q: Should I feel sore after every workout?
**A:** Some soreness is normal, but severe soreness indicates too much volume. Adjust accordingly.

### Q: Can I add cardio to this plan?
**A:** Yes, light cardio on rest days or after workouts. Avoid high-intensity cardio that interferes with recovery.

### Q: When will I see results?
**A:** Strength gains: 2-3 weeks. Visible changes: 4-6 weeks. Significant changes: 8-12 weeks.

### Q: What if 7.5kg becomes too easy?
**A:** Use advanced techniques first (tempo, pauses, techniques). Consider additional equipment later.

## ADVANCED TECHNIQUES - PRACTICAL APPLICATION

| Technique | How to Apply | Example |
|-----------|--------------|---------|
| **Drop Sets** | Normal set → immediate bodyweight/easier variation | Bicep Curls failure → Push-ups (triceps work) |
| **Rest-Pause** | Failure → 10 sec rest → 3-5 more reps → repeat 2-3 times | Chest Press: 8 reps failure, rest 10 sec, 3 reps, rest 10 sec, 2 reps |
| **Mechanical Drop** | Hard angle → easier angle with same weight | Standing Press → Sitting Press → Incline Press |
| **Pre-exhaustion** | Isolation first → compound second | Chest Flyes → Chest Press |
| **Cluster Sets** | 3 reps → 15 sec rest → repeat 4 times = 1 set | Squat: 3 reps, rest 15 sec, 3 reps, rest 15 sec, 3 reps, rest 15 sec, 3 reps |

## REST PERIODS & PROGRESSION

| Exercise Type | Rest Period | Progression Method |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Compound (Multi-joint)** | 90-120 seconds | Add reps first, then add tempo difficulty |
| **Isolation (Single-joint)** | 45-60 seconds | Add reps, then add pause/tempo |
| **High Intensity Techniques** | 2-3 minutes | Master technique first, then increase frequency |

## WEEKLY PROGRESSION GUIDE

| Week | Focus | Techniques |
|------|-------|------------|
| **Week 1-2** | Form & Tempo mastery | Basic tempos, perfect form |
| **Week 3-4** | Add intensity | Drop sets 1-2 exercises |
